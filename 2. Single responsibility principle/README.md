# Single responsibility principle
## Short
This principle suggests that each component or module in a program should have a single, well-defined responsibility, and should not be responsible for more than one aspect of the program. This can help to make the program more modular and easier to understand and maintain.
## Long
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is a software design principle that states that a class or module should have only one reason to change. This means that it should have a single, well-defined responsibility and that it should not be responsible for multiple unrelated tasks.

The idea behind the SRP is to encourage designers and developers to create small, focused classes and modules that are easy to understand and maintain. By following the SRP, designers can create software that is more flexible and easier to modify, as each class or module has a clear, defined responsibility.

For example, consider a class that is responsible for both reading data from a file and processing that data. If this class has two separate responsibilities, it may be difficult to understand and maintain, as changes to one aspect of the class (such as the file reading functionality) may have unintended consequences on the other aspect (such as the data processing functionality). By following the SRP, the designer could create two separate classes, one for reading the data and one for processing the data, which would make the system easier to understand and maintain.

Overall, the Single Responsibility Principle is a useful guideline for designers and developers who want to create software that is easy to understand, maintain, and modify. By following the principle, they can create software that is more flexible and efficient, and that is less prone to errors and bugs.

## Explanation with examples from non-programming activities
Imagine you are responsible for maintaining a garden. Your garden has a variety of plants, including flowers, vegetables, and herbs.

One way to apply the Single Responsibility Principle to this task would be to divide the garden into separate areas, each with its own specific purpose. For example, you could have one area for flowers, one area for vegetables, and one area for herbs. This way, each area of the garden has a single, well-defined responsibility, and you can focus on maintaining each area separately.

Another way to apply the Single Responsibility Principle to this task would be to assign specific tasks to different people. For example, you could have one person responsible for watering the plants, another person responsible for weeding, and another person responsible for pruning. This way, each person has a single, well-defined responsibility, and you can focus on completing each task separately.
