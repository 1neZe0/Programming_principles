# Combining series programming principles
## Briefly
Programming principles are guidelines that are used to help design and develop software in a way that is effective and maintainable. These principles provide a set of best practices and recommendations for designing software that is easy to understand, easy to modify, and easy to extend.

There are many different programming principles, and each one provides specific guidelines for designing and developing software. Some examples of programming principles include SOLID, KISS, DRY, and YAGNI.

It is important to know programming principles because they can help you create software that is more flexible, maintainable, and scalable. By following these principles, you can create software that is easier to understand, easier to modify, and easier to extend, which can make it easier for you to develop and maintain your software over time. Additionally, by following programming principles, you can help ensure that your software is reliable, robust, and efficient, which can help you deliver better software to your users.
