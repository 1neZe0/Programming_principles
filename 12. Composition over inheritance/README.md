# Composition over inheritance
## Short
This principle suggests that it is generally better to use composition, where one object contains or uses another object, rather than inheritance, where one object is a subclass of another object. Composition can be more flexible and easier to modify than inheritance, and can help to avoid the problems that can arise with deep inheritance hierarchies.
## Long
The composition over inheritance principle is a software design principle that states that it is generally better to use composition (the combination of simpler objects to form a more complex object) to achieve code reuse, rather than inheritance (creating a new class by inheriting the properties and behaviors of an existing class). The idea behind the composition over inheritance principle is to create systems that are more flexible and modular, by decoupling the relationships between different components of the system.

One way to apply the composition over inheritance principle is to use interfaces or abstract classes to define the relationships between different components of a system. By defining a clear interface or set of behaviors for each component, you can ensure that the components can be used in a flexible and modular way, and that they are not tied to a specific implementation or class hierarchy.

Another way to apply the composition over inheritance principle is to use composition to combine smaller, simpler objects into more complex ones. By using composition, you can create objects that are more flexible and modular, and that are not tied to a specific class hierarchy.

Overall, the composition over inheritance principle is a useful guideline for designing software that is flexible and modular. By following the principle, designers can create systems that are more resilient to change, and that are easier to modify and extend in the future. By using composition to achieve code reuse, rather than inheritance, designers can ensure that the system is more flexible and modular, and that it is less prone to errors and inconsistencies.
## Explain with examples from non-programming activities
Imagine you are in charge of organizing a charity car wash to raise money for a local animal shelter. You want to create a system that allows you to manage the car wash, track donations, and communicate with volunteers and donors.

One way to apply the composition over inheritance principle to this task would be to use interfaces or abstract classes to define the relationships between different components of the system. For example, you could create an "Event" interface that defines the core functionality of an event, such as the ability to manage attendees and track donations. You could then create concrete implementations of the interface, such as "CarWashEvent," which could implement the interface in specific ways. By following the composition over inheritance principle, you can ensure that the components of the system are flexible and modular, and that they are not tied to a specific implementation or class hierarchy.

Another way to apply the composition over inheritance principle to this task would be to use composition to combine smaller, simpler objects into more complex ones. For example, you could create a "DonationTracker" class that manages the process of tracking donations, and a "Communication" class that handles the process of communicating with volunteers and donors. You could then use composition to combine these objects into a more complex "CarWashEvent" object, which could use the "DonationTracker" and "Communication" objects to manage the car wash and communicate with volunteers and donors. By using composition to combine these objects, you can create a more flexible and modular system, and one that is not tied to a specific class hierarchy.
