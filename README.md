# Programming principles
There are review of several principles that are commonly followed in programming in order to make the code more readable, maintainable, and effective
With commentaries in code, explanations in article, examples from real world, and comparisons with bad code in different languages
### Principles to review sorted by importance-complexity index:
1. #### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
2. #### SOLID
3. #### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
4. #### YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)
5. #### Separation of concerns
6. #### Law of Demeter
7. #### Composition over inheritance
8. #### Single responsibility principle
9. #### Command-query separation
10. #### Open-closed principle
11. #### Liskov substitution principle
12. #### Interface segregation principle
13. #### Dependency inversion principle
14. #### Boy Scout rule
15. #### Don't make me think
16. #### Clean code combining a series of principles

Also in this repository, there will be a separate foray where clean code will be demonstrated, including a build image of all the principles.
This outing is number 16.
