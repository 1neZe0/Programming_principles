# Solid
## Short
This acronym stands for five principles of object-oriented design: Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. These principles are intended to help developers create more maintainable and flexible software.
## Long
The SOLID principles are a set of guidelines for object-oriented software design that were proposed by Robert C. Martin, also known as "Uncle Bob," in his 2000 paper "Design Principles and Design Patterns." The SOLID principles are intended to help designers and developers create software that is flexible, maintainable, and easy to understand.

#### The five principles of SOLID are as follows:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class or module should have only one reason to change. This means that it should have a single, well-defined responsibility and that it should not be responsible for multiple unrelated tasks. The idea behind the SRP is to encourage designers and developers to create small, focused classes and modules that are easy to understand and maintain. By following the SRP, designers can create software that is more flexible and easier to modify, as each class or module has a clear, defined responsibility.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (such as classes and modules) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that they should be designed in such a way that they can be extended to add new functionality, but their existing behavior should not be modified. The idea behind the OCP is to encourage designers and developers to create software that is easy to modify and extend, without requiring changes to the existing code. By following the OCP, designers can create software that is more flexible and maintainable, as new functionality can be added without changing the existing code.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types. This means that if a class is a subtype of another class, it should be able to be used in the same way as the base class without causing any problems. The idea behind the LSP is to encourage designers and developers to create software that is easy to modify and extend, by creating a hierarchy of classes that can be easily substituted for one another. By following the LSP, designers can create software that is more flexible and maintainable, as new functionality can be added without breaking the existing code.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means that a class should not depend on interfaces that provide more functionality than it needs. Instead, it should depend on small, focused interfaces that provide only the functionality that it requires. The idea behind the ISP is to encourage designers and developers to create software that is easy to modify and extend, by creating small, focused interfaces that are only used by the classes that need them. By following the ISP, designers can create software that is more flexible and maintainable, as new functionality can be added without changing the existing code.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This means that abstractions (such as interfaces or abstract classes) should be used to define the relationships between different components of a system, rather than relying on concrete implementations. This makes it easier to change and maintain the system, as the high-level modules are not directly dependent on the low-level modules. The idea behind the DIP is to encourage designers and developers to create software that is easy to modify and maintain, by using abstractions to define the relationships between different components of the system. By following the DIP, designers can create software that is more flexible and maintainable, as new functionality can be added without changing the existing code.

Overall, the SOLID principles are a set of guidelines that can help designers and developers create software that is flexible, maintainable, and easy to understand. By following these principles, they can create software that is easier to modify and extend, and that is less prone to errors and bugs.
## Explain with examples from non-programming activities
Imagine you are in charge of organizing a school library. You want to create a system that allows students to borrow and return books, but you also want to make it easy to add new features and functionality to the system in the future.
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): You could apply the SRP by creating a separate class for each responsibility of the library system, such as a "Book" class to represent individual books, a "Student" class to represent students, and a "Checkout" class to handle the process of checking out and returning books. This way, each class has a single, well-defined responsibility, and the system is easier to understand and maintain.
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): You could apply the OCP by using abstraction and inheritance to define the relationships between different components of the system. For example, you could create a base class called "Book" that defines the core properties and behaviors of a book, such as its title, author, and genre. You could then create derived classes that extend this functionality in specific ways, such as "Fiction" and "NonFiction," which could add additional methods or behaviors specific to those types of books. By following the OCP, you can ensure that the system is open for extension, as new types of books can be added to the system without changing the existing code.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): You could apply the LSP by ensuring that the derived classes are substitutable for the base class. For example, you could create a "Book" interface that defines the core methods that all books must implement, such as "getTitle()" and "getAuthor()." You could then create classes that implement this interface, such as "Fiction" and "NonFiction," which could implement the methods in a way that is specific to those types of books. By following the LSP, you can ensure that the derived classes are substitutable for the base class, and can be used in the same way without causing any problems.
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): You could apply the ISP by using multiple, smaller interfaces to define the relationships between different components of the system, rather than using a single, large interface. For example, instead of creating a single interface that defines all of the methods that a class must implement, you could create several smaller interfaces, each focused on a specific set of responsibilities. For example, you could create an "ElectronicBook" interface that defines methods related to electronic books, such as "getFormat()" and "getFileSize()," and a "HardcoverBook" interface that defines methods related to hardcover books, such as "getPageCount()" and "getISBN()." This way, clients are only required to implement the methods that they need, and are not forced to depend on methods that they do not use.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): You could apply the DIP by using abstraction and inheritance to define the relationships between different components of the system. For example, you could create a base class called "Book" that defines the core properties and behaviors of a book, such as its title, author, and genre. You could then create derived classes that extend this functionality in specific ways, such as "Fiction" and "NonFiction," which could add additional methods or behaviors specific to those types of books. By following the DIP, you can ensure that the high-level components of the system, such as the library itself, depend on abstractions rather than on specific implementations, and can be modified or extended without causing problems.
