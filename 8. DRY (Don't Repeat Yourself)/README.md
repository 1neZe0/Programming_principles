# DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
## Short
This principle suggests that it is important to avoid duplication of code in a program, as this can make the code more difficult to maintain and can lead to errors. Instead, it is recommended to use abstraction and modularization to reuse code whenever possible.
## Long
The Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle is a software design principle that states that you should avoid repeating the same code or information in multiple places. The idea behind the DRY principle is to encourage designers and developers to create software that is easy to understand and maintain, by reducing redundancy and duplication.

One way to apply the DRY principle is to use abstraction and inheritance to define the relationships between different components of a system. For example, you could create a base class or interface that defines the core functionality of a component, and derived classes or implementations that extend this functionality in specific ways. By following the DRY principle, you can ensure that the same functionality is not repeated in multiple places, and that the system is easier to understand and maintain.

Another way to apply the DRY principle is to use functions, modules, or libraries to encapsulate common functionality, and to reuse that functionality in multiple places. By encapsulating common functionality in a single place, you can avoid repeating the same code in multiple places, and can make it easier to modify and maintain the system in the future.

Overall, the DRY principle is a useful guideline for designing software that is easy to understand and maintain. By following the principle, designers can create software that is more flexible and maintainable, and that is less prone to errors and inconsistencies. By reducing redundancy and duplication, you can ensure that the system is easier to modify and extend in the future, without causing problems.
## Explain with examples from non-programming activities
Imagine you are in charge of organizing a community center that offers a variety of activities for people of different ages and interests. You want to create a system that allows people to sign up for the activities they are interested in, but you also want to make it easy to add new activities to the center in the future.

One way to apply the DRY principle to this task would be to use functions or modules to encapsulate common functionality, and to reuse that functionality in multiple places. For example, you could create a "Signup" module that handles the process of signing up for an activity. This module could have a function called "addParticipant()" that adds a new participant to the activity, and a function called "removeParticipant()" that removes a participant from the activity. By encapsulating this functionality in a single place, you can avoid repeating the same code in multiple places, and can make it easier to modify and maintain the system in the future.

Another way to apply the DRY principle to this task would be to use abstraction and inheritance to define the relationships between different types of activities. For example, you could create a base class called "Activity" that defines the core properties and behaviors of an activity, such as the name, age group, and number of participants. You could then create derived classes that extend this functionality in specific ways, such as "OutdoorActivity," "CraftActivity," and "EducationalActivity," which could add additional methods or behaviors specific to those types of activities. By following the DRY principle, you can ensure that the same functionality is not repeated in multiple places, and that the system is easier to understand and maintain.
